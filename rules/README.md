# Rules

## Structure

Rules are organized into a **common** layer plus **language-specific** directories:

```
rules/
├── common/          # Language-agnostic principles (always install)
│   ├── coding-style.md
│   ├── git-workflow.md
│   ├── testing.md
│   ├── performance.md
│   ├── patterns.md
│   ├── hooks.md
│   ├── agents.md
│   └── security.md
```

- **common/** contains universal principles — no language-specific code examples.
- **Language directories** extend the common rules with framework-specific patterns, tools, and code examples. Each file references its common counterpart.



## Rules vs Skills

- **Rules** define standards, conventions, and checklists that apply broadly (e.g., "80% test coverage", "no hardcoded secrets").
- **Skills** (`skills/` directory) provide deep, actionable reference material for specific tasks (e.g., `python-patterns`, `golang-testing`).

Language-specific rule files reference relevant skills where appropriate. Rules tell you *what* to do; skills tell you *how* to do it.

## Adding a New Language

To add support for a new language (e.g., `rust/`):

1. Create a `rules/rust/` directory
2. Add files that extend the common rules:
   - `coding-style.md` — formatting tools, idioms, error handling patterns
   - `testing.md` — test framework, coverage tools, test organization
   - `patterns.md` — language-specific design patterns
   - `hooks.md` — PostToolUse hooks for formatters, linters, type checkers
   - `security.md` — secret management, security scanning tools
3. Each file should start with:
   ```
   > This file extends [common/xxx.md](../common/xxx.md) with <Language> specific content.
   ```
4. Reference existing skills if available, or create new ones under `skills/`.
